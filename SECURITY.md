# Security Configuration

## Security Improvements Implemented

### 1. Input Validation
- ✅ Currency code validation (3-letter format, supported currencies only)
- ✅ Email format validation using regex
- ✅ Environment variable validation
- ✅ Input sanitization for email content

### 2. Network Security
- ✅ SSL certificate verification enabled
- ✅ Secure HTTP headers
- ✅ Request timeout configuration (30 seconds)
- ✅ Retry logic with exponential backoff
- ✅ Proper session management

### 3. Error Handling
- ✅ Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- ✅ Specific exception handling for different error types
- ✅ Secure logging without sensitive data exposure
- ✅ Graceful degradation on API failures

### 4. Dependencies
- ✅ Pinned dependency versions in requirements.txt
- ✅ Security-focused version ranges
- ✅ Optional security scanning tools (bandit, safety)

### 5. GitHub Actions Security
- ✅ Updated to latest action versions
- ✅ Job timeout configuration
- ✅ Dependency caching
- ✅ Artifact upload on failure for debugging

## Environment Variables Required

```bash
EMAIL_SENDER=your-email@gmail.com
EMAIL_PASS=your-app-password
EMAIL_RECIPIENT=recipient@example.com
```

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never commit credentials** - Use GitHub Secrets
2. **Use App Passwords** - Not your main Gmail password
3. **Monitor logs** - Check GitHub Actions logs for errors
4. **Regular updates** - Keep dependencies updated
5. **Enable 2FA** - On your Gmail account

## Monitoring

The application now includes comprehensive logging:
- Info level: Normal operations
- Warning level: Non-critical issues (e.g., currency not found)
- Error level: Critical failures

Logs are available in GitHub Actions and can be downloaded as artifacts on failure.

## Optional Security Enhancements

To enable additional security scanning, uncomment the security scan step in `.github/workflows/schedule.yml`:

```yaml
- name: Security scan
  run: |
    pip install bandit safety
    bandit -r . -f json -o bandit-report.json
    safety check --json --output safety-report.json
```

This will scan for:
- Common security issues (bandit)
- Known vulnerabilities in dependencies (safety)
